# MyYarnBuddy

MyYarnBuddy is a desktop application tool I developed to help me count stitches and rows on my crochet projects.
It also keeps track of the yarns and tools used for projects along with the start and end date.

- Written in Java
- Used JavaFX, CSS, FXML with SceneBuilder to create the GUI 
- Designed with MVC (Model-View-Controller) to allow navigation and interation with different pages
- Local persistent data stprage with serialization allowing users to save data

Improvements:
- Using a database to store information to be better secured
- Adding keybinding to make counting easier
- Add option to customize theme/color
